This folder contains image files used as textures in the game.

## Supported Formats

Unity supports various image formats:

## Texture Guidelines

- Keep texture sizes to powers of 2 (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, etc.)
- Use appropriate compression settings
- Consider creating texture atlases for better performance
- Organize by type (UI, environment, characters, etc.)
