# Prefabs

This folder contains Unity prefab files - reusable game objects.

## What are Prefabs?

Prefabs are pre-configured GameObjects that can be reused throughout your game. They're useful for:

- Characters and enemies
- Props and environment objects
- UI elements
- Particle effects
- Any GameObject you'll use multiple times

## Creating a Prefab

1. Create and configure a GameObject in your scene
2. Drag it from the Hierarchy to this folder in the Project window
3. The GameObject becomes a prefab instance (shown in blue in the Hierarchy)
